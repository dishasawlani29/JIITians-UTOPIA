Introduction: Brief introduction about a project. 
The purpose of our online PG portal is to provide a complete broker-free platform, which helps you realize your dreams by taking care of your accommodation needs and its associated areas of concern. Simply log on to our website, and you can find a myriad of property listings to choose from. Right from shared accommodation in a private room, we ensure to put an end to your accommodation hunt with a single click, that too within your budget.
In order to be more informative and transparent, we have posted a detailed description about the rooms which include their location, commutation facilities, entertainment hubs and prominent places surrounding it.
		Partnering with us resolves all the hassles the property owner faces. We take up all the responsibilities that comes with running a student accommodation, right from the beginning, i.e. Marketing the accommodation, handling the sales, facilitating the move in process, managing operations and maintaining the property.
Functionalities provided by the system are as follows:
1.	Provides searching facility for tenants according to the required location and budget.
2.	Allows landlords to rent their place without hassles of paid marketing.
3.	Provides a medium for transferring rent from tenants to landlord and keeping a track of past records.

(Laundry , AC, Wi-Fi, Power Backup etc)
5.	Provides a medium for the tenants to file complaints anything regarding the problem/malfunctions in the PG which will be directly addressed by the landlord.
